- *C2 Server* -->
  these are used by attackers to maintain communications with compromised systems within a target network

- *Payload server* -->
  this is a dedicated server hosting all the malicious scripts, executable etc... and this is accessible from both attacker and victim

*Redirector server* -->
a redirector is a system that proxies all traffic to your command and control server (C2)

threat actors doesn't use on system to launch attacks and get shells. They setup multiple systems to act as pivot points (redirectors) back to their C2 server

these prevent the client from beign able to see our actual C2, and should be easy to spin up and tear down

** adversary emulation
is mimicking of someone or something else, based on threat intelligence, you determine FIN10 group is most likely to target an organization

to emulate this adversary, you mimic the TTPs they use and test those in your environment. you behave exactly like they would

** adversary simulation
you want to make it look like a real attack is happening while there is no real adversary

you make use of TTPs that work in the environment at hand, irrespective of which APT actually uses them
