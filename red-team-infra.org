* red team infrastructure
- *C2 Server* -->
  these are used by attackers to maintain communications with compromised systems within a target network

[[./imgs/c2.png]]

- *Payload server* -->
  this is a dedicated server hosting all the malicious scripts, executable etc... and this is accessible from both attacker and victim

[[./imgs/payload_server.png]]

*Redirector server* -->
a redirector is a system that proxies all traffic to your command and control server (C2)

threat actors doesn't use on system to launch attacks and get shells. They setup multiple systems to act as pivot points (redirectors) back to their C2 server

these prevent the client from beign able to see our actual C2, and should be easy to spin up and tear down

** adversary emulation
is mimicking of someone or something else, based on threat intelligence, you determine FIN10 group is most likely to target an organization

to emulate this adversary, you mimic the TTPs they use and test those in your environment. you behave exactly like they would

** adversary simulation
you want to make it look like a real attack is happening while there is no real adversary

you make use of TTPs that work in the environment at hand, irrespective of which APT actually uses them

* DMZ demilitarized zone network
it is a network used to connect hosts that provide an interface to untrusted external network

the systems that are most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network, , such as e-mail, web and domain name systems (DNS) servers are present inside a DMZ

the ultimate goal of a DMZ is to allow access to resources from untrusted networks while keeping the private network secured

* MZ militarized zone network
zone having maximum security and is one of the most secure segment in the environment, contains critical information about the organization, all operations in the organization is managed from Militarized Network

* Tactics, Techniques and procedures (TTPs)
TTPs explains how threat actors orchestrate and manage cyber-attacks, it explains the methods associated with a specific threat actor or a group of treath actors

- ~tactic~ is the highest-level description of threat actor behaviour
- ~technique~ give a more detailed description of behaviour in the context of a tactic
- ~procedures~ an even lower-level, highly detailed description in the context of a technique

* malware phase types
** singles
these are self-contained payload assigned to do a specific task that is, create a user, or a bind shell

** stagers
these types payloads are used to download payloads to the target machine from the attacker machine
- creates a network connection between attacker & compromised machine
- *payload/windows/shell/bind_tcp*

** stages
these are the large payload downloaded by the stagers & then executed, assigned to do complex tasks like remote desktop
